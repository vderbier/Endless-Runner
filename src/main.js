Game title: Run Viking Run (endless runner)

Date completed: 7/6/21 (still working)

Creative tilt justification: 
    do something technically interesting? Are you particularly proud of a programming technique 
    you implemented? Did you look beyond the class examples and learn how to do something new?
        - The way time intervals between obstacles is implemented I think is rather interesting. What we did was count the frames
            since the last obstacle and chose a random number between an arbitrary interval, which represents the amount of frames
            to wait until the next obstacle is spawned. This interval got smaller as time increased so obstacles appear more often.
            The neat part We could count the frames because the update function occurs every frame.
    
    have a great visual style? Does it use music or art that you're particularly proud of? 
    Are you trying something new or clever with the endless runner form?
        -I, Bryson, thought my viking was way better than I was expecting. With the running animation, 
        I did some really cool math and usage of moving limbs via Adobe Illustrator.

A lot of the code is similar to Nathan Altice's MovementStudies Runner.js scene.
